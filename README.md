# **Twitter Interaction Analysis Tool**

A minimalist, no-nonsense tool for analyzing Twitter interactions, built with **Node.js**, pure **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. This project is designed to be as resilient bare metal, operating independently without the crutch of any frameworks or third-party services. It's just you, your code, and some raw Twitter data.

## **Features**
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication:** Securely connects to your Twitter account, so you can gather your data without selling your soul.
- **Interaction Analysis:** Fetches and analyzes interactions, identifying who’s paying attention to your tweets. Because you deserve to know who your biggest fans (or stalkers) are.
- **Lightweight & Portable:** No unnecessary dependencies here—just pure JavaScript that’ll run anywhere you need it.
- **Security Focused:** Sensitive information stays locked down with environment variables, strong session management, and rate limiting.
- **Open Source:** Released under the **GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)**, keeping it free and open for anyone to use, modify, and share. Sharing is caring, after all.

## **Usage**
Clone the repository, set up your environment variables, and let the server do its thing. This project is built for easy deployment and maintenance, with code so clean and readable that even your future self won’t curse you out.

## **Story Behind: How I Took My Twitter Interaction Analysis Tool Open Source**

### **The Beginning**
It all started with a simple idea: to create a tool that could reveal who’s been interacting with your Twitter account the most. I thought it’d be a fun little side project—something to sharpen my skills while scratching that data curiosity itch. So, I dove in, and before long, I had a tool that fetched tweets, analyzed interactions, and gave users a crystal-clear view of who was liking, retweeting, and engaging with their content.

### **The Problem**
But, of course, nothing worth doing is ever easy. Enter Twitter’s API limitations, the uninvited guest that crashed my party. Turns out, if you want more detailed analytics, Twitter expects you to cough up $100 a month for their Basic tier. For a side project? No, thanks. I was at a crossroads: I had a tool that worked, but I couldn’t fully unlock its potential without paying up.

### **The Solution**
Instead of letting the project gather dust, I decided to open-source it. Why not let the community take a crack at it? Maybe someone else could benefit, or maybe someone would be willing to shell out for Twitter’s API and push it further. 

### **Choosing the License**
Next was the license. I wanted this tool to stay free and open, no matter what. Richard Stallman’s philosophy on free software resonated with me, so I chose the **GNU General Public License (GPL) v3**. This way, anyone who uses or builds on this tool has to keep it open and accessible to others.

### **The Outcome**
And that’s how my Twitter tool went open source. It’s out there now, free for anyone to use, modify, or improve. Sure, it’s not as powerful as it could be without Twitter’s API fees, but it’s a solid foundation. If someone else wants to take it further, they can. That’s the beauty of open source—sharing, improving, and building on each other’s work.

So, if you’re curious about who’s been interacting with your tweets, or if you’re looking for a project to build on, check out the repo. And remember, when you’re working with APIs or sensitive data, double-check your code before you make it public. Future you will be grateful.
